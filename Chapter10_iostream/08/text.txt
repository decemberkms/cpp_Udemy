Four children have died and five others are injured after falling from a bouncy castle that was blown into the air in Australia, police say.

The accident - caused by a wind gust - happened on Thursday at a primary school fun day in Devonport, Tasmania.

Police said the children had fallen from a height of about 10m (32ft).

Authorities have not given ages for the children but said two boys and two girls had died.

Tasmania Police Commander Debbie Williams described the scene as "very confronting and distressing".

"It appears a wind gust caused the castle to lift into the air," she told reporters outside Hillcrest Primary School.
